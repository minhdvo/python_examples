# Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) 
It is a class of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for fluid simulation. 
Instead of solving the Navier–Stokes equations, the discrete Boltzmann equation is solved to simulate the flow of a Newtonian 
fluid with collision models such as Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK). By simulating streaming and collision processes across a limited 
number of particles, the intrinsic particle interactions evince a microcosm of viscous flow behavior applicable across the greater mass.
